I studied **biology** in the university of Oviedo, where I majored in **physiology**. As part of my degree studies, I worked on the Oftalmologic clinic Fernández-Vega , where I researched the effect of several neuropeptides on mice cornea receptors.

After graduating, I was invited to became part of Dr. Carlos López-Otín research group in the University, where, after several months learning on **molecular biology**, I started a Master on **biomedicine and molecular oncology**, which I finished by defending my work comparing the **degradome** of the sperm whale and other cetaceans.

This worked served as the foundation for my Ph.D., which I started shortly after in the same laboratory. Besides continuing working with the sperm whale genome, I reworked the research group webpage, redefining the database of proteases build and maintaned by our lab, the **degradome database**. For this and other purpoises I learned to code with the help of my thesis supervisor, Dr. Víctor Quesada. In addition to participate in different software development projects with him, I embarked (along with several of my coworkers) in the ambitious project of assembling, annotatin, and analysing the genome of Lonesome George, last member of *Chelonoidis abingdonii*, the giant tortoise from Pinta Island, in the Galápagos. As our lab worked its way towards unveiling new ageing mechanisms, I got the opportunity of participating in several other projects, including topics as varied as invertebrates genomes, or obesity.

Towards the end of my Ph.D. studies, I had the chance to spend three months with the Eukaryotic Annotation team in the EBI-EMBL, in Cambridge, where I got to further develop my experience with genome annotation.

Finally, as I was on the middle of a project concerning the Covid-19 pandemic, I presented and defended my doctoral thesis on the 15 of Octobre, 2020.

Currently, I find myself closing the projects I still have ongoing, while trying to figure out the next phase of my carrer.
