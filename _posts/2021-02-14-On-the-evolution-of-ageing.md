In 1958, Theodosius Dobzhansky published an essay discussing the relation between homoeostasis and senility, and how natural selection aﬀects both<sup>1</sup>. On it, Dobzhansky reﬂected on the concept of homoeostasis, deﬁned by Walter Cannon some years before as the “wisdom of the body”<sup>2</sup>, or the ability to, through controlled changes in the organism, adapt to changes in the eviroment, provided that they are within the “normal” changes the organism had evolved to withstand. He also linked this concept with ageing, by deﬁning the later as the reduction of this adaptability or plasticity agains “normal” enviromental changes. Speciﬁcally, he proposed that “the homeostatic buﬀering against enviromental shocks is weakened during the postreproductive phase”.

In his work “The Causes of Evolution”, Haldane considered this topic without any clear conclusion. To him, natural selection “may either favor or hinder the prolongation of life during the postreproductive phase”<sup>3</sup>. To Dobzhansky, the fact that homoeostatic mechanisms “tend to deteriorate during the autumm of life”, while the same function most eﬃciently during youth and maturity, is indication of how these are fashioned by natural selection. Of course, we now understand in much more detail how far the link between homoeostasis and ageing goes, knowing speciﬁc cell paths, cellular systems, and other homoeostasis mechanisms for which heritable malfuction (or even slightly under-optimal function) is a cause for a hastened ageing process.

After decades of tentative work on these determinants of ageing, in 2013, a seminal work ﬁnally established a precise framework to study how genetic determinants and their interaction with the environment regulates this process<sup>4</sup>. The framework is based on nine hallmarks of ageing.
